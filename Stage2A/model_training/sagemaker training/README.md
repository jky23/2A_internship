# AWS Sagemaker training

To train your model with AWS follow the notebook instance.
You will have to copy the following folders in the *code/* folder:

 - config
 - model
 - initmodel

The *requirements.txt* is also required and need to be upload. The *code/train.py* file is almost the same as the *train.py* file for local training. There are some Sagemaker Environments variables that were added.
